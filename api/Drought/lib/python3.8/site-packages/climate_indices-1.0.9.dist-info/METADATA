# Climate Indices in Python

This project contains Python implementations of various climate index algorithms which provide
a geographical and temporal picture of the severity of precipitation and temperature anomalies
useful for climate monitoring and research.

The following indices are provided:

- [SPI](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/standardized-precipitation-index-spi),
  Standardized Precipitation Index, utilizing both gamma and Pearson Type III distributions
- [SPEI](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252361460_The_Standardized_Precipitation-Evapotranspiration_Index_SPEI_a_multiscalar_drought_index),
  Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index, utilizing both gamma and Pearson Type III distributions
- [PET](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/dyk/potential-evapotranspiration), Potential Evapotranspiration, utilizing either [Thornthwaite](http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/21073)
  or [Hargreaves](http://dx.doi.org/10.13031/2013.26773) equations
- [PDSI](http://www.droughtmanagement.info/palmer-drought-severity-index-pdsi/),
  Palmer Drought Severity Index
- [scPDSI](http://www.droughtmanagement.info/self-calibrated-palmer-drought-severity-index-sc-pdsi/),
  Self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index
- [PHDI](http://www.droughtmanagement.info/palmer-hydrological-drought-index-phdi/),
  Palmer Hydrological Drought Index
- [Z-Index](http://www.droughtmanagement.info/palmer-z-index/),
  Palmer moisture anomaly index (Z-index)
- [PMDI](https://climate.ncsu.edu/climate/climdiv), Palmer Modified
  Drought Index
- [PNP](http://www.droughtmanagement.info/percent-of-normal-precipitation/),
  Percentage of Normal Precipitation

This Python implementation of the above climate index algorithms is being developed
with the following goals in mind:

- to provide an open source software package to compute a suite of
  climate indices commonly used for climate monitoring, with well
  documented code that is faithful to the relevant literature and
  which produces scientifically verifiable results
- to provide a central, open location for participation and collaboration
  for researchers, developers, and users of climate indices
- to facilitate standardization and consensus on best-of-breed
  climate index algorithms and corresponding compliant implementations in Python
- to provide transparency into the operational code used for climate
  monitoring activities at NCEI/NOAA, and consequent reproducibility
  of published datasets computed from this package
- to incorporate modern software engineering principles and programming
  best practices


This is a developmental/forked version of code that is originally developed and
maintained by NIDIS/NCEI/NOAA. The official release version is available at
